## Java GridBagLayout

The Java GridBagLayout class is used to align components vertically, horizontally or along their baseline.

The components may not be of same size. Each GridBagLayout object maintains a dynamic, rectangular grid of cells. Each component occupies one or more cells known as its display area. Each component associates an instance of GridBagConstraints. With the help of constraints object we arrange component's display area on the grid. The GridBagLayout manages each component's minimum and preferred sizes in order to determine component's siz
