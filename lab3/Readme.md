# Abstract class in Java
A class which is declared with the abstract keyword is known as an abstract class in Java. It can have abstract and non-abstract methods (method with the body).

Before learning the Java abstract class, let's understand the abstraction in Java first.

## Abstraction in Java
**Abstraction** is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.
Another way, it shows only essential things to the user and hides the internal details, for example, sending SMS where you type the text and send the message. You don't know the internal processing about the message delivery.

Abstraction lets you focus on what the **object** does instead of how it does it.

### Ways to achieve Abstraction
 - > Abstract class (0 to 100%)
 - > Interface (100%)

## Abstract class in Java
A class which is declared as abstract is known as an **abstract class**. It can have abstract and non-abstract methods. It needs to be extended and its method implemented. It cannot be instantiated.

### Points to Remember
    > An abstract class must be declared with an abstract keyword.
    > It can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
    > It cannot be instantiated.
    > It can have constructors and static methods also.
    > It can have final methods which will force the subclass not to change the body of the method.
    
# Inheritance in Java
Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object. It is an important part of OOPs (Object Oriented programming system).

The idea behind inheritance in Java is that you can create new classes that are built upon existing classes. When you inherit from an existing class, you can reuse methods and fields of the parent class. Moreover, you can add new methods and fields in your current class also.

Inheritance represents the IS-A relationship which is also known as a parent-child relationship.
